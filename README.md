# Learning-C-the-hard-way
Sample codes in c
Code written in this repository is done on nano using linux terminal(ubuntu). Gedit or vim could also be used for you to fully understand what happens in the background when you write your c code. To understand much better valgrind too is ran for so as to see the bottom line of what happens when code is ran.
For each exercise a make file is generated. 

This exercises are based on my journey as I learn C and share the experience on github.
As I move progress I will update this Readme file as to my current learnings.
